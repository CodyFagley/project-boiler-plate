The main goal of this project is to create reliable and accurate movements of the on screen curser with only the movement of the eyes. This will be attempted through the implementation of OpenCV api and several cameras. The main language that will be used in the implementation of the camera operation will be c++. The goal of this application is to drive a mouse based game through only the use of the user's eyes. An example of this would be a simple game of chess as a starting goal with a more involved game like Sid Mier's Civilization 5 being a strech goal.
